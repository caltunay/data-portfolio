# Bayesian A/B Test Sample Size Simulation

This is a Bayesian A/B test sample size simulation to help you understand how long it takes to reach a conclusive experiment.

App running at: https://cenan-altunay-bayes-rope-simulation.streamlit.app/

### Input Parameters
- **Control/Variant A Conversion Rate**: Enter the baseline conversion rate for the control group or variant A.
- **Practical Significance**: Enter your practical significance.
- **Daily Traffic Per Variant**: Enter the traffic per variant (control and treatment group).
- **Experiment Start Date**: Enter the start date of your experiment.

### Simulation Details
This simulation assumes the worst-case scenario where the treatment is just as good or worse than the practical significance. It will run 10 simulations over the course of a month but will stop early if conclusive results are found. However, it will always run for at least 14 days to ensure meaningful results.

Happy experimenting!
